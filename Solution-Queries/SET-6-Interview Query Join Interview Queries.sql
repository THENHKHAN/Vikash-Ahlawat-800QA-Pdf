output:Why RIGHT JOIN?????

-- We use RIGHT JOIN to list all projects, including ones not assigned to any employee.
-- It keeps all rows from ProjectDetail and joins matching employees from EmployeeDetail.
-- If no match is found, employee fields like e.employeeid will be NULL.
-- So we filter with: WHERE e.employeeid IS NULL
-- This gives us projects with no assigned employee.

-- This tells us: ‚ÄúGive me all projects that have no employee assigned.‚Äù
üßæ Sample Output:
| EMPID | firstname | projectname   | EMPID_FROM_Project |
| ----- | --------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| NULL  | NULL      | GL Management 2 |  NULL              |

üîç What does this row mean?

"GL Management 2" exists in ProjectDetail.
But it‚Äôs not linked to any employee.
That‚Äôs why employee columns are NULL after the join.

‚úÖ Why RIGHT JOIN is used:
We want to list all projects, even if they are not assigned to any employee.
RIGHT JOIN includes all rows from ProjectDetail, and joins matching employees from EmployeeDetail if found.
If no employee is found, the employee-related columns (EMPID, firstname) will be NULL.
So we filter for those NULLs to find unassigned projects: WHERE e.employeeid IS NULL
		 		 

technically both coprrect but:
WHERE e.firstname IS NULL ‚úÖ (correct and clear ‚Äî no matching employee)
WHERE p.employeedetailid IS NULL ‚ùå (risky ‚Äî depends on how data is stored)

üß† Best Practice:
Use nulls from the side you're testing for absence.

If you're using LEFT JOIN, check NULL on the right side.

If you're using RIGHT JOIN, check NULL on the left side (like e.firstname IS NULL).

		where e.employeeid in (select p2.employeedetailid from projectdetail p2 group by employeedetailid having  count(*)>1 )

/*
 * STEP-1: To see which employees have projects, we do a basic INNER JOIN:

3	Ashish	Task Track
3	Ashish	GRS
3	Ashish	DDS
4	Nikhil	HR Managment
6	Ravi	GL Managment

STEP-2:  Find employees assigned to multiple projects: will give 1,3 - this will be the  employeeid.
->We now need to identify which employees appear more than once in the ProjectDetail table.
->We do that with a subquery using GROUP BY and HAVING COUNT(*) > 1: 

(select p2.employeedetailid from projectdetail p2 group by employeedetailid having  count(*)>1 )
		This returns employee IDs with more than one project assigned.

				
then final
Step 3: Use that subquery to filter the main result
Now, we plug this into a WHERE ... IN (...) clause to get full project details for those employees:
employeeid  firstname   projectname
1			Vikas			Task Track
1			Vikas			CLP
1			Vikas			Survey Managment
3			Ashish			Task Track
3			Ashish			GRS
3			Ashish			DDS

üí° Intuition Recap:
Start with a basic JOIN to see who has projects.

Use GROUP BY + HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 to find employees with >1 project.

Use a WHERE ... IN (...) to filter full details for only those employees.

NEXT : We can achieve same result using a CTE or JOIN-based filter instead of IN!

üß† How to Approach (No query ‚Äî just thinking)
	‚úÖ Step 1: Understand your tables
	You likely have:
			EmployeeDetail ‚Üí info about employees (employeeid, firstname, etc.)		
			ProjectDetail ‚Üí info about projects, including which employee is assigned (projectname, employeedetailid, etc.)		
			So every row in ProjectDetail represents one employee assigned to one project.
	
	‚úÖ Step 2: What are you really trying to find?
			You want:			
			Projects that have more than one unique employee assigned.			
			Then, for each of those projects, show each employee's name.			
			So first find the projects with multiple employees, then use that to filter your results.
	
	‚úÖ Step 3: What column should you GROUP BY?
	Ask yourself:
	‚ÄúWhat defines a project?‚Äù ‚Üí projectname
	‚ÄúHow can I count how many employees are on each project?‚Äù ‚Üí COUNT(DISTINCT employeedetailid)
	
	That leads you to:
							GROUP BY projectname
							HAVING COUNT(employees) > 1

	‚úÖ Step 4: Do I need a subquery or join?
					Yes. You can:
					Use a subquery to first find those "multi-employee projects"
					Then JOIN that subquery back with the full data to get employee names
					Or:
		      		Use a CTE for readability

üõ† Tools You'll Use
INNER JOIN between employee and project tables
GROUP BY projectname
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

Possibly a subquery or CTE to isolate projects with >1 employee

üë£ Summary of Steps
Join employee and project tables to connect names and projects

Group by projectname and count employees

Filter for HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

Use that result to get full project + employee name info


/*
You can also write:

LEFT JOIN ‚Üí same as LEFT OUTER JOIN

RIGHT JOIN ‚Üí same as RIGHT OUTER JOIN

FULL JOIN ‚Üí same as FULL OUTER JOIN

üß† Summary:
‚úÖ INNER JOIN  Or Only JOIN‚Üí 1 type

‚úÖ OUTER JOIN means FULL JOIN or FULL OUTER JOIN ‚Üí 3 types:

LEFT OUTER JOIN 

RIGHT OUTER JOIN

FULL OUTER JOIN
